# Jenkins Job DSL Gradle Example 

An example [Job DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin) project that uses Gradle for building and testing. Check out [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSK_JaBacE0) for a walkthrough of this example (starts around 14:00).

# Script Examples

* [Example 1](jobs/example1Jobs.groovy) - shows basic folder/job creation
* [Example 2](jobs/example2Jobs.groovy) - shows how to create a set of jobs for each github branch, each in its own folder
* [Example 3](jobs/example3Jobs.groovy) - shows how to use the configure block
* [Example 4](jobs/example4Jobs.groovy) - shows a way to reuse job definitions for jobs that differ only with a few properties
* [Example 5](jobs/example5Jobs.groovy) - shows how to pull out common components into static methods
* [Example 6](jobs/example6Jobs.groovy) - shows how to include script resources from the workspace
* [Example 7](jobs/example7Jobs.groovy) - shows how to create jobs using builders

## Testing

`./gradlew test` runs the specs.

[JobScriptsSpec](src/test/groovy/com/dslexample/JobScriptsSpec.groovy) 
will loop through all DSL files and make sure they don't throw any exceptions when processed.

## Debug XML 

`./gradlew debugXml -Dpattern=jobs/**/*Jobs.groovy` runs the DSL and writes the XML output to files to `build/debug-xml`.

This can be useful if you want to inspect the generated XML before check-in.

## Seed Job

You can create the example seed job via the Rest API Runner (see below) using the pattern `jobs/seed.groovy`.

Or manually create a job with the same structure:

* Invoke Gradle script → Use Gradle Wrapper: `true`
* Invoke Gradle script → Tasks: `clean test`
* Process Job DSLs → DSL Scripts: `jobs/**/*Jobs.groovy`
* Process Job DSLs → Additional classpath: `src/main/groovy`
* Publish JUnit test result report → Test report XMLs: `build/test-results/**/*.xml`

## REST API Runner

A gradle task is configured that can be used to create/update jobs via the Jenkins REST API, if desired. Normally
a seed job is used to keep jobs in sync with the DSL, but this runner might be useful if you'd rather process the
DSL outside of the Jenkins environment or if you want to create the seed job from a DSL script.

```./gradlew rest -Dpattern=<pattern> -DbaseUrl=<baseUrl> [-Dusername=<username>] [-Dpassword=<password>]```

* `pattern` - ant-style path pattern of files to include
* `baseUrl` - base URL of Jenkins server
* `username` - Jenkins username, if secured
* `password` - Jenkins password or token, if secured
